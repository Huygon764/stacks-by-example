## Introduction

Stacks by Example is an introduction to [Clarity](https://clarity-lang.org/) smart contract development through simple, practical code examples.

Clarity is the smart contract language for the [Stacks](https://www.stacks.co/) blockchain. It is a decidable language, meaning you can know with certainty what a program will do before executing it. Clarity is interpreted, not compiled, and the source code is published on the blockchain.

## Examples

- [Hello World]({{ site.baseurl }}/hello-world) — Your first Clarity smart contract
- [Primitive Data Types]({{ site.baseurl }}/primitive-data-types) — Learn about uint, int, bool, principals, strings, and buffers
- [Variables]({{ site.baseurl }}/variables) — Data variables and maps for storing state
- [Constants]({{ site.baseurl }}/constants) — Define immutable values in your contracts
